# AvoidTheSpikes
A minigame made in Unity where as a bird you must dodge the oncoming spikes. 

This was created as a learning experience for Unity and game development in general. Any feedback or criticsm is welcome. 

Note: If you wish to play around with the Project in Unity, start with the Menu scene as it sets certain variables needed for 
the game to function properly.
