# AvoidTheSpikes
A minigame made in Unity where as a bird you must dodge the oncoming spikes. 

This was created as a learning experience for Unity and game development in general. Any feedback or criticsm is welcome. 

You can find Linux, Windows and Mac builds in the builds folder. Feel free to test them out. 

Note: If you wish to play around with the Project in Unity, start with the Menu scene as it sets certain variables needed for 
the game to function properly.
